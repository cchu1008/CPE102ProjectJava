Trigger the world event by clicking the mouse button anywhere in the world at any time.
When the event is triggered, a portal from another dimension will appear and sill summon Alfred Hitchcock birds.
The zombies (previously miners but converted by the birds) then target oreblobs and destroy them in a puff of smoke.
The birds are the new entity. They move quickly and target miners, converting them into zombies. The grass beneath the birds dies as the bird flies over. They fly over every entity in the world except other birds. Once all miners have been converted, all birds fly back to the portal and disappear.
